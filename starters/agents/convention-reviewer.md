# Convention reviewer

A focused lens: does this change obey the project's *own* documented rules? Native
`/code-review` hunts for bugs; this checks the conventions native review can't
know about.

## When to use
On a project with a real `AGENTS.md` (safety / cost / convention rules), right
before a PR. Run it *alongside* `/code-review`, never instead of it.

## What to do
1. Read the project's `AGENTS.md` (and any `@`-imported rules); extract the hard rules.
2. Diff the branch against its base. For each changed file, check it against each
   relevant rule (e.g. RLS on new tables, draft-filtered aggregates, no hand-edited
   generated files, no raw design literals, no cost-gated actions taken).
3. Report only real violations — cite the rule and the `file:line`.

## Report
A short list: `file:line — rule violated — fix`. If clean, say so in one line.
Don't edit — just report.
